    <h1>Question And Answer Blog:-</h1>

        <h3>Question Number 1: What is difference between localstorage and sessionstorage?</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:-</span> localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions.
            So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved.
            There is no expiration. sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long
            as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new
            session and new storage.<br><br>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following
            rules:</p>
        <p>1.They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</p>
        <p>2.The values stored may only be strings.</p>
        <p>3.They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</p>

        <h3>Question Number 2: What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:-</span> Global Scope variables defined outside of any function or
            curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables
            can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
            <br><br>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
            variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
            statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
            brackets {}.</p>

        <h3>Question Number 3: How javascript event loop works?</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:-</span> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to
            be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event
            loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call
            Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process. The event queue is
            responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to
            maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. Whenever an async
            function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser.</p>
